# PyBer_Challenge

## Overview & Purpose

This project is to visualize the rideshare data for a Pyber,a ride sharing company to help them to improve their ridesharing services.This will further help the company to understand the cities and their riding trends.To do this they have provided us two different data files which have information about the cities and the rides. We will do our analysis process on these two files and merge them together to create a summary Data file. We will also create a line chart graph to visualize the weekly graph of rides by the city type that is urban, suburban, rural.

We will use python,Matplotlib and Pandas libraries to create data-frames and visualize the data.

## Results

### Summary DataFrame


We read the data from two different files and concluded into one data frame.

- The highest revenue generating city type is Urban which is $39,854.38.
- Urban revenues is more than twice of revenue of suburban city type which sits at $19,356.33.
- The total number of urban rides are 1625 which is 1500 more rides than rural rides.This concludes that urban rides are 13x the rural rides.
- Same scenario in case of number of drivers,the total number of urban drivers.Urban drives are 31 times higher than rural count of drivers.Sub urban       driver count is aproximately 0.25 of the urban driver count.
- According to the basics of the bussiness,more the volume lower the average price of the sale gets.The average ticket of the urban ride is lowest         averageing $25.53 per ride.The lowest revenue genrating categoty has highest average ticket of $34.62
